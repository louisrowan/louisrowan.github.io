<h2 style="color:red">About</h2>


<p>This website is about the coolest animal around, the Hippopotamus. Hippos are among the most feared animals in all of Africa, due to their giant size, teeth and ferocity. They are the third-largest land animal behind only the Elephant and Rhinoceros, and can live in the wild for as long as 50 years. They spend up to 16 hours per day in water, a necessity in the African heat to keep their bodies cool.</p>

<p>Hippos live in groups called schools, which usually consist of 10-30 hippos, one of which is the dominant male.

<h3>Existing Site:</h3>
<p>Here is a link to an <a href="http://www.animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/hippopotamus/">Existing Website</a> on Hippos. The formatting on this page is much better than my site, I like how everything flows together. Text is wrapped around images, there is a drawing on the top of the page that turns into a background behind the page content. There is a lot of information in the head about margins and padding which are apparent when viewing the page, as the content isn't all smushed up against the side of the page like it is on mine. It's much easier to read this way. There is something in the head under script about 'adsbygoogle', which I assume has to do with inputing google sponsored ads onto the page.

Another feature I like is that when you click an image, it pops up and displays it much larger. Also, the page looks presentable no matter how it's viewed or how zoomed in the browser is. My site looks much different if I have my browser full screen compared to half screen.
